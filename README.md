# MVC Course Report Page

## Intro

Welcome to the MVC Course Report Page project! This web application, built using the Symfony framework and managed with Composer, serves as a dynamic platform for displaying and managing course reports. It leverages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to provide a clean separation of concerns, making it easier for developers to maintain and enhance the application.

## Setup

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- PHP 8.2 or newer
- Composer
- Symfony CLI

### Cloning the Repo

To get started with the MVC Course Report Page on your local machine, first, you need to clone the repository. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/albinr/mvc-report
cd mvc-report
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once you have the project's source code, use Composer to install the project's dependencies. Run:

```bash
composer install
```

### Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can start a PHP server to run the application locally:

```bash
php -S localhost:8888 -t public
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8888 in your web browser to view the application.
